# Full_Stack_Web_Development_Nanodegree

Learn to design and develop powerful modern web applications that form the foundation for the apps, websites, and systems that people and businesses use every day.

## SQL and Data Modeling for the Web

In this part, you’ll be building out the data models and database for an artist/venue booking application. The fictitious startup Fy-yur is building a website that facilitates bookings between artists who can play at venues, and venues who want to book artists.
 - Project: Fyyur: Artist Booking Site

## API Development and Documentation

In this part, you will use the skills you’ve developed to build a Trivia API. The goal of this project is to use APIs to control and manage a web application using existing data models. You’ll be given a set of data models and the application front end. Your task will be to implement the API in Flask to make the Trivia game functional.
 - Project: Trivia API
 
 ## Identity and Access Management
 
In this part, you will build the backend for a coffee shop application. You’ll add user accounts and authentication to your application and use role-based access management strategies to control different types of user behavior in the app.
 - Project: Coffee Shop Full Stack
 
 ## Server Deployment, Containerization and Testing
 
In this part, you will create a container for your Flask web app using Docker and deploy the container to a Kubernetes cluster using Amazon EKS. By the end of the project, you will have deployed your application live to the world, where it should be accessible by IP address.
 - Project: Deploy Your Flask App to Kubernetes Using EKS
 
 ## Capstone Project
 
 You will now combine all of the new skills you’ve learned and developed in this course to construct a database-backed web API with user access control. You will choose what app to build and then you’ll design and build out all of the API endpoints needed for the application and properly secure them for use in any front end application (web or mobile).
